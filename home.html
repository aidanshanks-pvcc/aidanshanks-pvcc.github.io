    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The Bureau of land management is a US government agency that, as the name implies, manages the land owned by the federal government. The goal of the Bureau of Land Management is “to sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.” Currently they manage 245 million acres of public land, 1/10 of the total land in the US, and 700 million acres of mineral resources. Most of this land is divided up between National Parks, Conservatories, Archaeological sites, and more.

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>After the American Revolution, the 13 Colonies had made promises to many soldiers and other helpers in the war efforts of land, primarily coming from the territory to the west of the colonies, previously regions they were unable to travel to or develop because of British regulations. Although some of the land was given directly by states such as Virginia or North Carolina. Maryland, deciding that the land to the west must be managed somehow, refused to sign the articles of confederation unless the 7 colonies with claims to the western regions ceded them. Much of the land remaining was given to soldiers for their service and the remaining land was given to the United States as public land. Originally, these lands were managed by the secretary of the Treasury, but in 1812, the General Land Office was created to assist in the management of these lands.
    </p>
    <p>After many disputes between cattle ranchers over the public grazing lands being overcrowded and eventually becoming barren, the Division of Grazing(Later renamed the U.S. Grazing Service) was created by the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, named after a Congressman from Colorado.
    </p>
    <p>Due to competition for funding, both groups failed to do their duties, leading to ineffective use of resources. Because of this competition, a few years later in 1946, Harry S. Truman, advised by Harold Ickes, his secretary of the Interior, merged the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service in order to form the Bureau of Land Management that we know today.

    <h3>Duties</h3>
    <p>The duty of the Bureau of Land Management is to manage the land that belongs to the Federal Government. They manage historical sites such as national monuments, historic trails, and archeological sites, preserve designated landscapes like wilderness areas, scenic rivers, as well as assist in the sustainable use of lands in order to produce resources with sites such as mines, energy farms, and the animals that live in the US. In order to do a good job of maintaining the land, the BLM follows the <a href ="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-43/subtitle-B/chapter-II/subchapter-D/part-4100/subpart-4180">rangeland health standards and guidelines</a>, developed in the 1990s with some assistance from the American Populace. The BLM works by dividing America’s territories into 12 interior regions, varied by the size of the land within and the locations of the territories. Each region is run by a different division in the Bureau of Land Management in order to ensure that all of the public lands of the US are well cared for and maintained.

    <h3>Cooperation</h3>
    <p>When talking about the management of national lands, the first thing that many people think of is the National Park service, who manage all of the national parks in the US like the Yellowstone, Shenandoah or Sequoia national parks. In contrast to the national parks, the Bureau of Land management deals with  a wider scope of America’s land including the National Wildlife Refuges, Historical Monuments, trails, conservation areas, and more!
